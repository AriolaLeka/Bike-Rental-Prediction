## Introduction

Bike sharing systems have gained popularity as a new generation of bike rentals, offering an automated process from membership to bike rental and return. This project aims to predict the number of total bikes rented (count) based on various features recorded from bike-sharing systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a set of features recorded from bike-sharing systems. It includes information such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors that may influence bike rentals. The dataset is available [here](link_to_dataset).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we performed standard descriptive statistics, visualized variables using graphs, drew distributions and histograms, and explored correlations between different features. Some interesting observations and insights we discovered include [mention a few interesting findings].

## Preprocessing

Before building the prediction model, we preprocessed the data to handle unknown values, normalize features, and prepare the dataset for training. This step ensures the data is in the right format and quality for model development.

## Prediction Model

We built a prediction model to estimate the number of total rental bikes based on the provided features. We [briefly describe the chosen model or approach, e.g., linear regression, decision tree, neural network, etc.] and explain how the model was trained using the preprocessed dataset.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the accuracy of our prediction model, we used [describe the evaluation metrics used, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.]. The model's performance was compared against the actual values provided in the dataset.
